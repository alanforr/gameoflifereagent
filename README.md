# gameoflifereagent
I wrote game of life in Clojurescript
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life
using Reagent 

https://reagent-project.github.io/

and the Clojure CLI tools:

https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli

The project can be run on the command line with figwheel, which provides a REPL and hot code reloading:
https://figwheel.org/
using the command:
clj -R:repl build.clj figwheel
